# Compressor-white-noise
The file COMPRESSOR_BITES_10.py is a test and validation environment designed to measure the efficiency of a massive data compression engine. Tests indicate savings ranging from 6% for pure white noise to 25-27% for structured data. 

If, after reviewing the code architecture and the presented metrics, you confirm that the tests are correct, I invite you to contact me to discuss the technical details and commercial potential of the 'Compressor,' a disruptive technological asset capable of redefining Big Data storage.
